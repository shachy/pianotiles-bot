# pianotiles-bot
A real work piano tiles pixel color checker

If your screen pixels are not sincronized with the code just change the pixels in the `if pyautogui.pixelMatchesColor(pixel-x, pixel-y, (0, 0, 0))`
and in the `click(pixel-x, pixel-y)`

For using the bot you will need to install: `pyautogui, win32api, keyboard and import time`
